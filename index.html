            <h2>What is Botox?</h2>
            <p>Botox is a highly effective, non-surgical treatment that reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by temporarily relaxing the underlying facial muscles. Commonly treated areas include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Forehead lines</li>
                <li>Crow's feet around the eyes</li>
                <li>Frown lines between the eyebrows</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With Botox, you can enjoy smoother, younger-looking skin with results that can last up to four months.</p>

            <h2>Discover the Benefits of Dermal Fillers</h2>
            <p>Dermal fillers are another popular option for combating the signs of aging. These injectable treatments restore volume to the face, smooth out deep wrinkles, and enhance facial contours. At Ziya Skin Clinic, we use premium fillers that provide natural-looking results. Dermal fillers can be used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plump up thin lips</li>
                <li>Enhance shallow contours</li>
                <li>Soften facial creases</li>
                <li>Improve the appearance of recessed scars</li>
            </ul>
